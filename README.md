### The AVR / MCU audio synthesizer design  
Jan Ostman was no longer public for the selling and ripped off all those content, someone were telling payment done but never received ordered stuff, something was odd. This is the blog/code and copied content, from the google and searched.

I had a few of the test rig build according to the design and code, and must be clear to say, Jan Ostman was genius in this territory or perhaps professional, but overall it is not to comment any of those selling or biz.

### my build and test
I had chance that to build one from the Jan's project but lost all those learning notes as the PC switched and moving living town, this is perhaps the first time and able to recovered those code and to learn those designs again.
