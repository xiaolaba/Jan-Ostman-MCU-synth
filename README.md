# Jan-Ostman-MCU-synth
Do not use for comercial, for own education purpose only!!! AVR / MCU audio synthesizer design, this is the blog/code and copied content, from the google and searched.   

The AVR / MCU audio synthesizer design, Jan Ostman was no longer public for the selling and ripped off all those content, someone were telling payment done but never received ordered stuff, something was odd. This is the blog/code and copied content, from the google and searched.

I had a few of the test rig build according to the design and code, and must be clear to say, Jan Ostman was genius in this territory or perhaps professional, but overall it is not to comment any of those selling or biz.

Jan Ostman's work pieces, all gone except webarchive machined.

I had chance that to build one from the Jan's project but lost all those learning notes as the PC switched and moving living town, this is perhaps the first time and able to recovered those code and to learn those designs again.
